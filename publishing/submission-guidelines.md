## Understand roles and responsiblities
Publishing often involves different people with different roles and responsibilities including data stewards and data custodians. Sometimes a single person plays both roles, while in many cases the roles are split among people or teams.

### Data Steward
Data Stewards are individuals in charge of individual databases, datasets, or information systems. In general, a data steward has business knowledge of the data and can answer questions about the data itself. General responsibilities likely include:

- Managing the dataset or source and authorizing changes to it
- Managing access to and use of the data, including documentation
- Managing accuracy, quality and completeness of the data
- Answering questions related to data as needed

**Note:** You should not be publishing a dataset without input from the data steward.

### Data Custodian
Data Custodians are individuals that assist with the technical implementation of individual databases, datasets, or information systems. Not all systems or data sources will have a data custodian. General responsibilities likely include:

- Implementing technical changes requested by the data steward
- Administration and maintenance for the database or system
- Coordinating any technical work necessary for automated open data publishing. You can learn more about this in the [automation services guidance](/publishing/services/).


## Conduct an internal review

### All Datasets

Before you publish the data, make sure you review your plans to publish the data with your internal stakeholders:

- **Data Coordinator**. At a minimum, work with your Data Coordinator to plan how to publish your data.
- **Program subject matter experts**. They can help identify what data fields are most useful or important. They can also generate ideas for how the data can be used.
- **Reporting staff**. Open data is a great way to help streamline reporting. Reporting staff can help identify what summary tables and fields are needed to help with their work.
- **Leadership**. Depending on the dataset, you may need to communicate the publication with leadership. Consult with your Data Coordinator on this.
- **Public Information Officer and Sunshine responders**. These folks are a great source of insight on common questions that you can address with open data. Posting and keeping a dataset up to date is a great way to answer ongoing Sunshine requests.
- **Legal and privacy staff**. If there is any question whether your data is sensitive or protected, the City Attorney&#39;s Office and any privacy or security staff can serve as a resource.

### Sensitive and Protected Datasets

As part of the publishing process, you will classify your data as public, sensitive or protected:

- **Public**. This data could be publicly disseminated without any concerns.
- **Sensitive**. In its raw form, this data poses security concerns, could be misused to target individuals or poses other concerns.
- **Protected**. This data is protected by law or regulation and can only be shared or accessed internally and per organizational procedures; OR this information includes individually identified information.

If your data is sensitive or protected, we will walk you through a decision-making process to help assess whether de-identified data should be published. The primary steps are:

1. Review the [Open Data Release Toolkit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MhvEuGKFuGY2vLcNqiXBsPjCzxYebe4dJicRWe6gf_s/edit?usp=sharing) for familiarity with this topic and instructions.
2. Fill out the [Open Data Release Form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cxjyIivWzlG4Rf_8c0XAq-I-z3Dd3lJOEaI-UP2c_4g/edit?usp=sharing) based on the instructions provided  in the Toolkit.
3. Review your completed [Open Data Release Form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cxjyIivWzlG4Rf_8c0XAq-I-z3Dd3lJOEaI-UP2c_4g/edit?usp=sharing) with DataSF staff.

If you have any questions about this process or the Toolkit, or require help at any step, please [contact us](http://support.datasf.org/customer/portal/emails/new).

## Clearly define your datasets for an external audience
Not everyone will have as deep an understanding of the data's context. As part of the publishing process we capture a certain amount of metadata that helps provide context. While many of these are drop downs, there are a handful of fields that are open text. Below are some guidelines and examples for the dataset's **title** and **description** as well as definitions for **categories**.

### Title guidelines

Make sure your title is descriptive and as concise as possible.

- Spell out acronyms or avoid jargon if at all possible
- Include date ranges only if appropriate


### Description guidelines

Make sure your description addresses the following points where appropriate:

- Who collects the data or who is the source of the data
- How is the data collected
- Why is this data collected and what is it used for (include relevant ordinance references, if applicable)
- What are the programs or policies that this data supports

### Title and description examples

**Title:** Buyout Agreements
**Description:** Contains buyout declarations and buyout agreements filed at the Rent Board. Rent Ordinance Section 37.9E, effective March 7, 2015, is a new provision that regulates "buyout agreements" between landlords and tenants under which landlords pay tenants money or other consideration to vacate their rent-controlled rental units. For more information, please see: http://sfrb.org/new-ordinance-amendment-regulating-buyout-agreements

**Title:** Affordable Housing Pipeline
**Description:** Snapshot of Mayorâ€™s Office of Housing and Community Development (MOHCD) and the Office of Community Investment and Infrastructure (OCII) affordable housing pipeline.

Data used for tracking affordable housing production that is financed or supported by MOHCD and OCII and informs affordable housing production policies and initiatives. as of June 30, 2016.
