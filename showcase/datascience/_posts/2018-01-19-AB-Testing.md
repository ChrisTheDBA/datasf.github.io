DataSF offers AB testing design workshops to departments interested in comparing the effectiveness of different forms of communications, e.g. letters or emails. The redesign of your communication rests on using the principles of Make it Easy, Attractive, Social and Timely or EAST, a framework developed by the Behavioral Insights Team.

Once we design a new letter or communicaiton using the EAST principles, we conduct an experiment (AB test it). The wait it works is that:

* We identify the target population
* Split it randomly into two groups: treatment and control
* Run the text
* Compare the results

On this page we will add AB experiments as they are complete. 

## Treasure Tax Collector: A bettter letter 

The Office of the Treasurer & Tax Collector (TTX) collects City taxes on a range of things, including

* Taxes on land and buildings (real property) and
* Taxes on office furniture, boats, equipment, etc (personal property)

The key difference between real and personal property is that the City has the right to seize land and buildings if taxes go unpaid. This gives the City a bit more leverage. But when it comes to personal property, the City relies on self-reported values and cannot simply seize the property if taxes are not paid. This is the difference between a “secured” and “unsecured” tax.

That’s why the Office thought behavioral science insights could help make their tax payment letter more compelling.

### Before / After

To improve the letter, the Office partnered with DataSF to conduct a workshop where five teams competed to design a better letter. The winning letter design used the key concepts of making it easy, attractive, social and timely.

The image below provides before and after with the behavioral insights used. In particular, we leveraged concepts of making it easy, using social comparison and norms and making the action items more attractive.

### Experiment and Results

To test the new letter, the Office randomly split the 3,495 delinquent taxpayers into 2 groups:

* 1,732 received the old notice (control)
* 1,763 received the new notice (treatment)

Responses were due December 15, 2017. Based on a rspose rate of 16.3% for the treatment and 14.0% for the control, we can say with 90% confidence that the new letter improved the response rate. In this case, it improved it by 17%.

TTX is now looking to run experiments on all of its tax letters!
