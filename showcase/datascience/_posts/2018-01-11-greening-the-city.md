When was the last time you decided to upgrade your light bulbs? If you’re like many folks, you wait until a light 
bulb burns out. In your home or apartment, you might have at most 20-30 bulbs.

But if you own a commercial property or lease a commercial space, your strategy might be a bit different. If you 
have 100s or 1000s of lightbulbs, there is tremendous cost savings potential from migrating from wholesale to light 
bulbs using newer more energy efficient technology.

For the first 100 years of electrical lighting, the incandescent bulb reigned supreme. While it provided needed light, 
it burns a lot of energy and releases excessive heat. In fact, the California Energy Commission officially prohibited 
the sale of incandescent bulbs in our State in January 2018.

Designed to consume less energy, lighting technology progressed with the mass-market introduction of compact 
fluorescent lamps in 1995. However, as soon as they had their heyday, Light Emitting Diodes or LEDs came on the 
scene.

3 bulb technologies and captions on how evolved

With each advancement in improved lighting technology, the City and County of San Francisco (City) wants to do 
all it can to encourage lighting upgrades, Commercial property and business owners are great lighting upgrade 
candidates, and the City is available to provide technical assistance and incentives to help with project 
implementation and upfront costs.

## Background: The City offers help to make energy upgrades simple

While a lighting upgrade of 100s or 1000s of bulbs may make financial sense for a property or business owner, it 
still requires upfront dollars. That upfront cost is often a barrier. This is why the City’s Department of Environment 
(SFE) offers incentives to property owners and businesses to help encourage them to make the switch to the most 
efficient bulbs in the market that also fit the needs of building occupants. Since 2006, the San Francisco Energy 
Watch program implemented by San Francisco Environment (SFE) has assisted local businesses and multifamily 
building managers or owners lower their energy bill through energy efficiency assessments and financial incentives, 
while also reducing San Francisco's impact on the environment.

These energy incentives are part of the City’s wider goal to significantly reduce energy consumption through energy 
efficiency upgrades by 2030[^1],  and ensure that 100% of the electricity supplied by the grid to San Francisco residents 
and businesses is renewable by 2030. Together these steps will help the City significantly reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2050. With targets this high - every lightbulb helps.

## Service Question: SFE had helped most of their clients upgrade their lighting - could they find new leads?

SFE staffers had a challenge: they had helped most of the clients in their database and suspected there may be 
additional properties that could benefit from the program. However, SFE first needed to know if they had saturated 
the market and if not, how best to generate new leads. SFE also wanted to understand if additional upgrade potential 
existed within their existing list of clients for different energy efficiency measure incentives.

Something about declining uptake?

## What We Did: Building permits can help identify new clients

DataScienceSF explored what made for good candidates (leads) for lighting upgrades in the past. One key finding 
was that applicants for building permits where more likely to take advantage of energy efficiency incentives: 
Completed upgrades were nearly 2 times as likely to have applied for permits within prior 5 years and nearly 3 times 
as likely to have applied within 1 year.

Completed retrofits were more likely to have applied for a building permit

We also found that the majority of past projects focused on smaller buildings with smaller energy savings. Was there 
an opportunity for bigger energy savings?

Most upgrades were in smaller buildings with smaller energy savings

## Implementation: Enriched list of property leads feeds new client outreach strategy

Based on the findings, DataScienceSF created a long list of potential leads. We combined data on property use, 
permitting activity, and energy consumption to help prioritize targets. The new list relied heavily on data already 
published through the open data portal. We then matched it with properties in SFE’s existing database to easily 
identify properties that already existed in the database.

This project prompted a new idea: combine this data with building energy consumption data from PG&E to further 
refine SFE’s outreach strategy. This approach will allow staff to develop comprehensive energy proposals - not just 
lighting - to target clients.
