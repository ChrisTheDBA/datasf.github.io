Projects are chosen through a bi-annual selection process. &nbsp;The final product of DataScienceSF isn't a recommendation or a report but service change.&nbsp;</p><div style="text-align:center;"><img alt="" width="469" height="296" src="/uploads/versions/dsscsw-small---x----469-296x---.png" /></div><div style="text-align:center;">&nbsp;</div><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>What types of problems can DataScienceSF solve?</h2><p>There are five basic types of civic problems data science can help address. &nbsp;Ask yourself if you or people in your department would want to:</p><p><img alt="" width="800" height="398" src="/uploads/versions/artboard-1---x----800-398x---.png" /></p><p>You can learn more and see examples of civic data science projects from other cities in our PowerPoint deck.&nbsp;</p><h2>What are the expectations for the department?</h2><p>First and foremost we are committed to realizable service change. &nbsp;</p><p>To do this we work closely with a <strong>Department Champion. &nbsp;</strong>The Department Champion is our liaison within the department who helps refine the problem statement and identify paths to service change.</p><p>Engagements last between 1-4 months. &nbsp;The engagement will be an iterative process as we refine the original problem statement into something answerable with the data available and implementable within any service change constraints. &nbsp;</p><p>As part of the engagement we may schedule 'ride-alongs' where members of the data science team shadow employees to identify relevant implementation factors that should be incorporated into the statistical model.</p><p>We estimate the Departmental Champion will, on average, need to dedicate 5 hours a week to this project.&nbsp;</p><h2>What is the life cycle of a data science project?</h2><p><img alt="" width="1141" height="290" src="/uploads/versions/timeline---x----1141-290x---.png" /></p><p>A more detailed overview can be found on our&nbsp;<a href="http://clever-goat1.cloudvent.net/science/processmap">process map</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="" src="/uploads/versions/process-map---x----304-502x---.png" width="304" height="502" /></p><p><span style="color: rgb(109, 188, 226); font-family: Montserrat, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 28px; font-weight: 700;">Application Process</span></p><ul><li>Fill out <a href="https://sfgov.forms.fm/datasciencesf">an application</a> by&nbsp;<strong>May 19th at 5pm.</strong></li><li>Be available for questions while DataSF defines and selects projects</li><li>DataSF will select finalists projects based on this list of criteria</li><li>&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>We look forward to your submissions!</h2><p>&nbsp;</p></div>
