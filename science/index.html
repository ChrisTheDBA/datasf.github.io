    text_html: '<h3>Flag "stuff" early</h3><p>Do you find it hard to predict future conditions leading to reactive services? Many situations - good and bad - could be addressed more efficiently if caught early, even before they come to you. Data science identifies candidates for early intervention and engagement.</p>'

            <div class="content editable"><h1>DataScienceSF</h1><h2>What is DataScienceSF?</h2><p class="present-before-paste">DataScienceSF is a way for you to harness the power of advanced analytics and applied statistics to implement a tool that helps improve your work.</p><p class="present-before-paste">This new service from DataSF aims to help departments achieve more with their existing resources and processes.</p><p class="present-before-paste">Through a 4 month engagement, DataSF&rsquo;s Data Science team and your department will refine a problem, identify statistical methods to address it, and develop and institute a service change tool to improve your work. Projects are chosen through a bi-annual selection process. The final product of DataScienceSF isn't a recommendation or a report but a service change.</p><div style="text-align:center;"><img alt="" width="469" height="296" src="/uploads/versions/icons---big---datascience--service-change---x0-4-938-592-469-296x---.png" /></div><div style="text-align:center;">&nbsp;</div><h2>What types of tools does DataScienceSF use?</h2><p>DataScienceSF will bring 3 key tool sets to bear on your data science questions:</p><ul><li><strong>Statistical Methods.</strong> DataScienceSF will use the right method for your problem. Methods we may use include sentiment analysis, machine learning, regression, data mining, classification, clustering, imputation, AB testing, forecasting and more.</li><li><strong>Tools.</strong> We use a variety of languages, libraries, data engineering and visualization tools. Languages include python, R, Javascript, NodeJS and SQL with a variety of libraries (SciPy, Pandas, etc). Our data engineering tools include profiling, ETL, noticing, APIs and optimized data pipelines and storage/access. Visualization tools include D3.js, Gephi, Leaflet, PowerBI, ggplot2 and Shiny.</li><li><strong>User Experience Research.</strong> Key to a successful data science project is the implementation of a service change via a data driven tool. We use a variety of tools to assess and help design the right implementation including journey and process mapping, service blueprinting, ethnographic research and ride alongs to iterative prototyping and usability testing.</li></ul><p>Collectively, these tools allow us to create an actionable data insight to improve your work.</p><h2>What types of problems can DataScienceSF solve?</h2><p class="present-before-paste">There are five basic types of civic problems data science can help address. Ask yourself if you or people in your department would want to:</p></div>

We will refine and clarify roles and responsibilities via a project charter.</p><ul><li class="present-before-paste"><strong>Commitment to service change.</strong>&nbsp;First and foremost we expect departments to be open to and commit to a service change if that's where the data leads us.</li><li class="present-before-paste"><strong>Department Champion.</strong>&nbsp;To be an effective partner, we will need a Department Champion.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>The Department Champion is our liaison within the department who helps refine the problem statement and identify paths to service change. We estimate the Departmental Champion will need to dedicate on average 5 hours a week to this project. This will probably taper off after the beginning.</li><li class="present-before-paste"><strong>Commit to working within our timeframe.&nbsp;</strong>Engagements last between 1-4 months. The engagement will be an iterative process as we refine the original problem statement into something answerable with the data available and implementable within any service change constraints. If now is not a good time, we will have future cohorts.</li><li class="present-before-paste"><strong>Access to staff and business processes. </strong>As part of the engagement we expect to do user research. This may include 'ride-alongs', where members of the data science team shadow employees, interviews or other research methods. This will help identify relevant implementation factors that should be incorporated into the statistical model.</li><li class="present-before-paste"><strong>Timely data access. </strong>Any data science project relies on timely data access. Please plan on preparing and working with your technology or database team to provide data. As appropriate, we can sign data sharing MOUs (we have templates). Some projects may require ongoing data access to implement the model in real time.</li><li class="present-before-paste"><strong>Presenting and Disseminating. </strong>Part of our goal is to document and communicate what we learn and accomplish so both other departments and jurisdictions can benefit. We will need input and feedback and some participation from departments in this process.</li></ul><h2><span style="color: rgb(109, 188, 226); font-family: Montserrat, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 28px; font-weight: 700;">Application Process</span></h2><ul><li><strong>May 19th.</strong> Fill out our <a href="https://sfgov.forms.fm/datasciencesf">very brief application</a> by <strong>May 19th at 5pm</strong></li><li><strong>May 22-June 2.</strong> Be available for questions while DataSF defines and selects projects</li><li><strong>June 7. </strong>Winners announced.
