Projects are chosen through a bi-annual selection process. &nbsp;The final product of DataScienceSF isn't a recommendation or a report but service change.&nbsp;</p><div style="text-align:center;"><img alt="" width="469" height="296" src="/uploads/versions/dsscsw-small---x----469-296x---.png" /></div><div style="text-align:center;">&nbsp;</div><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>What types of problems can DataScienceSF solve?</h2><p>There are 5 basic types of civic problems data science can help address. &nbsp;Ask yourself if you or people in your department would want to:</p><p><img alt="" width="800" height="398" src="/uploads/versions/artboard-1---x----800-398x---.png" /></p><p>Click on each type to learn more and see examples of civic data science projects from other cities.&nbsp;</p><h2>What are the expectations for the department?</h2><p>First and foremost we are committed to realizable service change. &nbsp;</p><p>To do this we work closely with a <strong>Department Champion. &nbsp;</strong>The Department Champion is our liaison within the department who helps refine the problem statement and identify paths to service change.</p><p>Engagements last between 1-4 months. &nbsp;Completing data science projects in this time frame requires strong commitments from departments and the Departmental Champion. &nbsp;The engagement will by nature be an iterative process as we refine the original problem statement to be something answerable with the data available and implementable within any service change constraints. &nbsp;</p><p>As part of the engagement we may schedule 'ride-alongs' where members of the data science team shadow employees to identify relevant implementation factors that should be incorporated into the statistical model.</p><p>We estimate the Departmental Champion will on average need to dedicate 5 hours a week to this project.&nbsp;</p><h2>What is the life cycle of a data science project?</h2><p><img alt="" src="/uploads/versions/timeline---x----1141-290x---.png" width="1141" height="290" /></p><p>A more detailed overview can be found on our&nbsp;<a href="http://clever-goat1.cloudvent.net/science/processmap">process map</a>.</p><p><img alt="" src="/uploads/versions/process-map---x----304-502x---.png" width="304" height="502" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: rgb(109, 188, 226); font-family: Montserrat, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 28px; font-weight: 700;">Application Process</span></p><ul><li>Fill out <a href="https://sfgov.forms.fm/datasciencesf">an application</a> by&nbsp;<strong>May 19th at 5pm.</strong></li><li>Be available for questions while DataSF defines and selects projects</li><li>DataSF will select finalists projects based on this list of criteria</li></ul><p>We look forward to your submissions!</p></div>
