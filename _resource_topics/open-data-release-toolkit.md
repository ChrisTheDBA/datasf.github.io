The purpose of this Toolkit is to provide guidance and a consistent process for Office of the Chief Data Officer (OCDO) staff, department management and Data Coordinators in the City and County of San Francisco (CCSF) to release sensitive or protected datasets on the SF Open Data portal. Datasets published on the portal must be designated by departments as falling within one of three data classifications - public, sensitive or protected. Sensitive or protected data is generally data that is protected by privacy law or regulation, identifies individuals, could be misused to target individuals and/or poses other concerns. 

We seek to publish data responsibly. This requires a balancing of competing factors, such as:

- the value of publishing the data,
- an individualâ€™s expectation of privacy,
- repercussions to an individual or the organization from re-identification, and
- the likelihood of re-identification.  

The toolkit covers the process in detail. It is used in conjunction with the form when going through the [open data publishing process](https://datasf-github-io-jasonlally.c9users.io/publishing/submission-guidelines/#toc3).
