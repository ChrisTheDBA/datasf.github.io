This Toolkit contains a step-by-step process to assess the release of de-identified sensitive or protected datasets on the SF Open Data portal. Sensitive or protected data is generally data that is protected by privacy law or regulation, identifies individuals, could be misused to target individuals and/or poses other concerns.

We seek to publish data responsibly. This requires a balancing of competing factors, such as:

* the value of publishing the data,
* an individual’s expectation of privacy,
* repercussions to an individual or the organization from re-identification, and
* the likelihood of re-identification.

The Toolkit covers the process in detail. It is used in conjunction with the [Open Data Release Form](https://drive.google.com/open?id=12uk04YOXqP10oqFy6EcJ-wRa0IrGx1B-BaCNUITP-EA) when going through the [open data publishing process](https://datasf-github-io-jasonlally.c9users.io/publishing/submission-guidelines/#toc3).
