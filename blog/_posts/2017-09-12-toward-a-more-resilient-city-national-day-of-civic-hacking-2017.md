The annual [National Day of Civic Hacking is upon us](https://www.codeforamerica.org/events/national-day-of-civic-hacking-2017). On [Saturday, September 23rd, Code for San Francisco will bring together up to 100 folks](http://ndoch2017.codeforsanfrancisco.org/) to consider how we can make our City more resilient in the face of disaster.

With hurricanes Harvey and Irma, the 8.0 earthquake off the coast of Mexico, or even the recent heat wave in the Bay Area, we are being constantly reminded of how important recovery and resiliency is in a world with increasing threats, both natural and human-driven. We also know how important it is to contribute to recovery efforts elsewhere.

During this yearâ€™s event participants will:

* learn about what the City is doing to strengthen our own resiliency,
* engage in a hands-on disaster planning and recovery exercise,
* learn ways to contribute volunteer skills to resiliency efforts, and
* contribute to projects that are aiding in resiliency and recovery here and in other communities

Code for San Francisco has partnered with the [Neighborhood Empowerment Network](http://empowersf.org) (NEN), the [San Francisco Department of Emergency Management](http://sfdem.org)&nbsp;(DEM), [DataSF](https://datasf.org)&nbsp;and community members to develop the program.

DataSF will be on hand to provide help with available data and insights on ways we can share data to prepare our neighborhoods. NEN and DEM will provide subject matter expertise and take participants through the exercise.

This is a timely and important conversation for us to be having, and [we encourage you to participate if you can](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/national-day-of-civic-hacking-tickets-36960808774). Ticket proceeds will be donated by Code for San Francisco to ongoing recovery efforts. Code for San Francisco wants this to be inclusive event, so if the cost is a barrier, please reach out to [hello@codeforsanfrancisco.org](javascript:void(location.href='mailto:'+String.fromCharCode(104,101,108,108,111,64,99,111,100,101,102,111,114,115,97,110,102,114,97,110,99,105,115,99,111,46,111,114,103))) and they can waive that for you.

We look forward to seeing you there!
