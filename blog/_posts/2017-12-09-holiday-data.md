Instead of braving the airport and the stress of holiday travel why not stay here in SF!&nbsp; There is a multitude of free holiday activities open to the public.&nbsp; The below maps harnesses open data, APIs, and good ol fashioned google searching to identify some holiday activities for you and yours.

## See one of San Francisco's publicly maintained Holiday Tree and Plants

Sure you could buy a pre-cut Christmas tree or pre-plucked Holly but why not check out one of the publicly maintained Christmas Trees and Plants.&nbsp; San Francisco has them all from Douglas Fir to English Holly.&nbsp; Thanks to an astoundingly detailed [Open Tree Map](http://urbanforestmap.org/about/) you can now know exactly where they are. The data powering the map is collected via the [Street Tree Census](http://sf-planning.org/everytreesf-%E2%80%93-street-tree-census), a project of [SF Planning](http://sf-planning.org/everytreesf-%E2%80%93-street-tree-census), [SF Public Works](http://sfpublicworks.org/services/urban-forest-plan), [Friends of the Urban Forest](http://www.fuf.net/), [Arbor Pro](http://www.arborprousa.com/), and volunteer tree mappers who are blessed with a year round giving spirit. See below map for locations.&nbsp; Note: The census is currently underway so only certain neighborhoods have been surveyed at this point. You can receive updates about the project from [here](http://urbanforestmap.org/blog/).
