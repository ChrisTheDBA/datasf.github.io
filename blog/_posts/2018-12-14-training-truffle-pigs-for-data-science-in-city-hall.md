## Finding the perfect project is easy? Hogwash

Data science is a powerful tool that can accelerate the work of local governments and data scientists are beating at our door to work on projects with high impacts (optimizing a marketing algorithm gets boring after a bit). But, the biggest barrier to more data science in government is identifying good questions.

In both New Orleans and San Francisco, we needed to transition from one-off, ad-hoc projects towards sustainable analytics programs that advance our respective mayors’ most important priorities.

Much of the creativity and operational know-how to identify good data science projects exists in departments and with their staff. But how do you harness that knowledge and translate the language of data science into their work?

## Enter the truffle pig

Truffles - which can fetch up to $10,000 per pound – are some of the world’s finest delicacies. They are also some of the most elusive. To capture this rare treat, truffle hunters train the snouts of pigs to ferret out a truffle trove with even three feet of dirt in the way.

We needed a truffle pig for data science.

The team in New Orleans (led by founding director, Oliver Wise, and including Richard Todd, now an analytics project manager in the City of Seattle) developed [a typology of analytics projects](http://datadriven.nola.gov/nolalytics/) that provides a generic set of “recipes” in simple language. The typology allows frontline city employees and departmental leadership to translate analytic approaches to their common operational challenges.

After introducing this typology city-wide, our team received more than 20 viable project proposals, far more than we expected. With the luxury of a wide range of candidate use cases, we were able to strategically select projects with the greatest likelihood of impact, strongest alignment to the City’s policy priorities, and that best enabled capacity development for future projects. In addition, by cultivating a cache of potential projects, we are better positioned to take advantage of pro-bono resources (from academia, start-ups, nonprofits, etc.) that might come our way.

We plan to harvest another crop of use cases in the coming months, so stay tuned.

## San Francisco joins the passel

After hearing about New Orleans’ success, we at DataSF decided to riff on it and use the typology in our own solicitation process for [DataScienceSF](https://datasf.org/science/). We added cute graphic explanations and made some language changes based on user testing and card sorting.

Most importantly, we saw similar success to New Orleans, with 20 applications for our first data science cohort. Since then we’ve developed a set of resources for scoping and managing data science projects. You can learn more about and use them in our [DataScienceSF Resource Library](https://datasf.org/resources/datasciencesf/).

The lesson: A plain language typology combined with relevant examples gives potential clients a framework that helps them relate data science to their world.

Try it in your City and let us know how it goes!
