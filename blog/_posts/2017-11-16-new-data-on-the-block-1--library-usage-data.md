This is the first in a series of posts in which we highlight recently published data to the open data portal

I don’t know about where you work, but around DataSF books rule. While we often geek out over city data or the newest visualization technique, nothing quite compares to a good book, a comfy chair, and a rainy day. That’s why we are so excited to reveal the latest addition to the open data portal: library usage data! The library usage dataset contains de-identified data about the total number of checkouts and renewals across a host of categories. Take an unprecedented peek into the voracious book, audiobook, and e-book consumption habits of San Franciscans. Follow along and prepare to have your assumptions challenged and learn about your fellow San Franciscans impressive love of books!

## What age group uses the library the most?

Think you’re hot stuff because you always have a book in hand? How does your checkouts per year stack up against the under 9 crowd… That’s what I thought. [Locate your closest library](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?ll=37.75684299999998%2C-122.444366&amp;spn=0.095003%2C0.145912&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;z=12&amp;source=embed&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;mid=1B8aE_aJusm_OGyajBH7pW_EfDdo) and catch up!
