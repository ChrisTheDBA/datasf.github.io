On Tuesday, December 12, 2017 Mayor Edwin Mah Lee, or MEL as we liked to call him, passed away. Below is our homage to MEL in the language we know best, data.

## XXXX new housing units built under MEL - more than the past 30 years

Anyone who knew the Mayor, knew he was passionate about housing. Sometimes, it was hard to get him to talk about anything else. And the proof is in the numbers.

## Creation of x,xxx affordable housing units

The map below shows the 25 neighborhood commercial corridors that received customized assistance to meet their needs through Invest in Neighborhoods.

These include economic development services such as loan programs, facade improvement grants, and technical assistance for small businesses.

## Every resident within a 10 minute walk of a park

Under Mayor Lee, San Francisco was the first city in the nation to be given a perfect park access score from The Trust for Public Land’s ParkScore. The City’s rich store of recreation locations mean every resident isn’t more than 10 minutes from a park.

## 283 new open datasets published in the last four years

Lastly, since we run the open data program, we of course have to pay homage to the work MEL empowered us to support every day. Since the Mayor revitalized our open data program in 2014, we’ve published 283 new datasets or 62% of the total published.
