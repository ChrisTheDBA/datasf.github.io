We quietly posted our [annual plan update](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cVqhRQXq5LJ7XQtA-OjmEXe6penlqI6DY8mY84_wlb0/edit?usp=sharing) last month. A few updates on Year 2 and some teasers on what’s coming.

## Our favorite things from Year 2

* New team members. Janine and Erica joined DataSF to accelerate data automation and services and internal data sharing, respectively. [Read more about them and how awesome they are](https://datasf.org/about/).
* 133 new datasets versus 49 last year (171% increase) and the&nbsp;[automation program](https://datasf.org/publishing/automation/) to make it happen
* 2 rounds of [publishing plans](https://datasf.org/publishing/plans/) and [automated reporting](https://datasf.org/progress/) on [open data metrics](https://datasf.org/blog/how-to-measure-open-data/)
* Brand new [help desk](http://support.datasf.org/) with 384 tickets and counting
* 34 classes via [Data Academy](https://datasf.org/academy/)
* Advancing data governance and infrastructure through ShareSF, HOPE SF, Our Children Our Families and more
* New partners with [What Works Cities](http://whatworkscities.bloomberg.org/) and the [Harvard Ash Center](http://ash.harvard.edu/civic-analytics-network)

## Focus in Year 3

In Year 3, we are maintaining and improving our open data work but deepening and expanding work in several additional areas:

* Internal data sharing for coordinated care
* Data infrastructure and services
* Data governance and management (we added a new goal for this)
* Putting our data to work with analytics and special projects


## Some fun things underway this quarter (Jul - Sep)

* Re-imagining the open data portal experience
* Relaunching geo data to be easier to use
* A framework for open data and privacy
* Faster, easier, better data publishing
* Metadata platform
* Data quality tools and resources
* Unifying our web properties
