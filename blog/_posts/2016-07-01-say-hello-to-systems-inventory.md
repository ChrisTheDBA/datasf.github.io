We are happy to announce that our [citywide systems inventory](https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Catalog-of-citywide-enterprise-systems-of-record/ebux-gcnq) is now live! The scope of the inventory was defined by [California Government Code 6270.5](http://bit.ly/CAinventory), which was enacted by Governor Brown after the State Legislature passed SB 272.

We want to acknowledge all of the tremendous effort of City departments, and in particular their Data Coordinators. This really did take a lot of work, but reflects a continued commitment to transparency and open government on the part of San Francisco.

The systems inventory joins its sister, the [dataset inventory](https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Dataset-Inventory/y8fp-fbf5), which is the result of [our landmark open data legislation](http://www.govtech.com/e-government/SF-Mayor-Signs-Landmark-Open-Data-Policy-and-Procedures-Legislation.html). San Francisco passed the nation’s first local open data law in 2010 and it was subsequently strengthened and supported by Mayor Lee, former Board President Chiu and Supervisor Farrell. That law laid the foundation, and Mayor Lee has continued commitment to the program by empowering DataSF to [mature the open data initiative](http://sfmayor.org/index.aspx?recordid=639&page=846) beyond maintaining lists and catalogs of data.

Our dataset inventory has now become a piece of infrastructure for managing the open data program. We use it to [measure](https://datasf.org/progress) and [monitor](https://datasf.org/publishing/plans) our progress and to track datasets as [they move through our publishing process](https://datasf.org/publishing).

The systems inventory is another addition to all the [tools](https://datasf.org) and [resources](https://datasf.org/resources) developed to empower use of the City’s data. We continue our steady commitment to that every day, and are motivated and inspired by the people we serve and work with. Enjoy the new dataset!
