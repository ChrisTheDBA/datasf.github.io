On February 16th nearly 100 city analyst packed into a room in City Hall to for the Mayor’s inaugural Data and Innovation Awards.  In November, Mayor Ed Lee sent out a call for the most innovative and data driven projects City and County employees had completed in the last year.  And City Departments answered that call! Over 60 submissions were received for the 6 award categories.

We are proud to announce (and share!) the winners as well as allow you to see their presentations in full.  Be prepared, the presentation skills on display are something else.
