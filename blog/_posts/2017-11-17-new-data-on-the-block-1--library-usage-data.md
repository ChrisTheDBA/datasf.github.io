New year, new feature! This is the first in a series of posts in which we highlight recently published data to the open data portal.

I don’t know about where you work, but around DataSF books rule. While we often geek out over city data or the newest visualization technique, nothing quite compares to a good book, a comfy chair, and a rainy day. That’s why we are so excited to reveal the latest addition to the open data portal: library usage data! The library usage dataset contains de-identified data about the total number of checkouts and renewals across a host of categories. Take an unprecedented peek into the voracious book, audiobook, and e-book consumption habits of San Franciscans. Follow along and prepare to have your assumptions challenged and learn about your fellow San Franciscans impressive love of books!

## What age group uses the library the most?

Think you’re a big reader? &nbsp;How do your checkouts per year stack up against the under 10 crowd… [Locate your closest library](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?ll=37.75684299999998%2C-122.444366&amp;spn=0.095003%2C0.145912&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;z=12&amp;source=embed&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;mid=1B8aE_aJusm_OGyajBH7pW_EfDdo) and catch up!

## What is the distribution of patron activity?

The chart(s) below highlights that among active patrons – those that have checked out at least 1 book – most active patrons on average check out less than 10 books a year.&nbsp; However it is the long tail of the distribution that is responsible for the most of the checkouts.
