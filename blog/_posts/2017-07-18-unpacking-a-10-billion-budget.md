Today the City and County of San Francisco released its 2017-18 budget of $10.11 billion. With a budget that size, many people wonder why we can’t address every need and concern across the City. Conor Johnston, former Chief of Staff to Board of Supervisors President London Breed, has done a great job unpacking it with these [two](http://www.sfexaminer.com/where-did-all-our-money-go/) [articles](http://www.sfexaminer.com/san-franciscos-9-billion-question/). This blog post provides a visual walk through of those articles.

## Compare apples to apples

San Francisco’s budget appears to have nearly doubled since 2006-2007. But, when you adjust for inflation and population, it actually grew 12.5% from $8.23 to $9.59 billion between 2006-2007 and 2016-2017.

Looking at the budget from the perspective of dollars per person, the City spent roughly $9,600 per person in 2006-2007 versus $11,000 in 2016-2017.

## How did we spend the increase in the general fund budget

The $1.05 billion increase in our general fund budget between 2006-2007 and 2016-2017 was spent on health care, more police officers, improved streets, care for our kids, affordable housing and overall increased services.

Another way we can look at this is by comparing the growth of Health & Human Services (driven largely by the Affordable Care Act, which covers more than 133,000 previously uninsured San Francisco residents) to increases from all other departments. Half of the increase in general funds has gone to health care.

## Enterprise vs General Fund

Self-supporting “enterprise” departments make up nearly half of the budget. These departments include the San Francisco International Airport, the Port, the Municipal Transportation Authority, and the Public Utilities Commission. Enterprise dollars are restricted in how they may be spent. The remaining departments make up the General Fund, which is $5.1 billion for the 2017-18 fiscal year. When budget discussions happen, most of the time, everyone is discussing the general fund, which is where most discretionary dollars exist.

## How the annual general fund budget is spent

Over the years, City residents have voted for certain mandatory spending - what are called set asides. These include baseline spending and service levels for public safety, transportation and children’s services. This reduces the general fund from $5.1 to $3.9 billion. Police and Fire, including voter-mandated force size requirements, make up nearly another $900 million. This brings the general fund from $3.9 billion to $3 billion. The big players in health, namely the Human Services Agency and Department of Public Health, book a combined $1.7 billion budget and leave us with a $1.3 billion General Fund. Other department dollars fund existing services and staff. When it’s all said and done, do you know how much the Mayor directly allocates this year? About $36 million. That’s less than 1% of a ten billion dollar budget.
