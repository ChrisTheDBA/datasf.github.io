Halloween is almost upon us. If you are in need of costume ideas or spooky places to visit you are in luck, thanks to the&nbsp; [SF Film Commission](http://filmsf.org/)â€™s [Film Locations dataset](https://data.sfgov.org/Culture-and-Recreation/Film-Locations-in-San-Francisco/yitu-d5am). This dataset collects every location in our fair city used to shoot movies, tv shows or documentaries (more than 1,500 locations!).

We combined the films dataset with the wonderful [Open Movie Database API](http://www.omdbapi.com/), [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/), and some technical wizardry. The result: a curated map of SF filming locations of a selection of Halloween-themed movies.

Want to take your costume game to the next level? Dress up as a hero or monster and recreate scenes from the movie in the actual filmed location! Tweet any results to @DataSF.

Want to be extra scary? Snap a pic at a horror movie location from each of the horror movies shot in SF.

Whatever you decide, make sure to have fun and be safe!
