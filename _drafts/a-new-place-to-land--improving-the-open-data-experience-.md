We’re happy to announce a new feature on San Francisco’s open data portal! Socrata has [improved the user experience around datasets through dataset “Primers.”](https://support.socrata.com/hc/en-us/articles/221691947-Socrata-Primer-a-dataset-s-landing-page) This feature serves as a landing page for datasets, allowing San Francisco department publishers to better highlight important metadata and related content.

Along with an improved search experience launched last year, the portal continues to improve to better serve our users. Plus, we’ve worked closely with Socrata to restitch two of our web properties together through consistent navigation across the portal and DataSF’s other initiatives.

We’ll continue to monitor the implementation of these changes and advocate for and advance our user’s needs wherever we can. One initiative currently underway is t[he collection and improvement of field level metadata](/blog/show-me-the-data-dictionary/). Keep an eye out on the blog for more in the future.
