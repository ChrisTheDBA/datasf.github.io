## About this course

This course is designed to give you a strong foundation in Power BI and a jumpstart on your 1st Power BI project.

Power BI is a powerful, low-cost entrant into the dashboarding field that focuses on the entire business intelligence chain: from data wrangling to visualizing to sharing to automation. &nbsp;Most BI programs (such as Tableau) focus primarily on the visualization component, which often leaves a user having to do significant (often repetitive) ‘data wrangling’ in excel before it is ready to import.

Power BI also has substantial visualization/sharing/automation abilities allowing for easier exploration of your department’s data by your co-workers and the public. &nbsp;Instead of always having to calculate how many X are in Supervisorial District Y, you can now create an embed-able chart on your department website that provides always up to date estimates.

## What you'll learn in this course

* Import and data wrangle data from various sources
* Join multiple datasets for analysis
* Visualize/map the results
* Automate the entire process
* Share your work privately within the city or publicly
* Best practices for documenting and managing your workflow
* Tips and Tricks specially designed for the data needs of CCSF employees
* Note: class is dedicated to practice, not high level overview or comparison to other programs. &nbsp;Contact mayor.cdo.intern@sfgov.org to get the CCSF powerBI brown bag slidedeck which dives into those areas.
