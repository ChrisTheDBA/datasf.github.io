We quietly posted our annual plan update last month. A few updates on Year 2 and some teasers on what’s coming.

## Our favorite things from Year 2

* 133 new datasets versus 49 last year (171% increase)
* 2 rounds of publishing plans and automated reporting on open data metrics
* Brand new help desk with 384 tickets and counting
* 34 classes via Data Academy

## Focus in Year 3

In Year 3, we are maintaining and improving our open data work but deepening and expanding work in several additional areas:

* Internal data sharing for coordinated care
* Data infrastructure and services
* Data governance and management (we added a new goal for this)
* Putting our data to work


## Some fun things underway this quarter (Jul - Sep)

* Re-imagining the open data portal experience
* Relaunching geo data to be easier to use
* A framework for open data and privacy
* Faster, easier, better data publishing
* Metadata platform
* Data quality tools and resources
* Unifying our web properties
