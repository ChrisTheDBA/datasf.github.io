The DataSF team has come a long way in maturing our publishing approaches, including working with a range of datasets of varying complexity. Weâ€™ve also made continuous and ongoing improvements, including:

* Establishing a more robust automation environment
* Introducing a bulk publishing process and templates to bundle data publishing more efficiently
* Issuing updated versions of the publisher packet based on experience and feedback to reduce prep time
* Identifying publishing process bottlenecks and opportunities for automation or process improvements
* Standardizing publishing support processes via our help desk

While the improvements have helped to varying degrees, we feel we are reaching the upper limit of what parts of our technical stack can handle. Particularly, as we push into more advanced uses of open data throughout the City.

## The need for scale

The challenges of scaling are motivated by our simple mission to ***empower use of the City's data***. If our mission was to place data in a repository, well then, we would care much less about scale. Get it out there and done, right? But when focused on the user and the challenges facing them, you feel the pain caused by a constrained data environment.

Data that does not flow (appropriately) through the organization and within society limits us in our collective progress. An inadequate data infrastructure and poor data management means:

* policy decisions based on stale or stagnant data, or none at all
* services poorly aligned to serve residents in most need
* staff unable to easily understand how their work relates to the bigger picture
* little understanding of impacts related certain programs or policies

## A generalized architecture for scale

Over the next year, we'll lay out more specifics on how we're scaling our data work, but we've started with a very generalized draft architecture. It attempts to provide greater flexibility and accommodate more modes of data sharing over time.
