## XXXX new housing units built under MEL - more than the past 30 years

## 25 neighborhoods benefited from economic investment

The map below shows the 25 neighborhood commercial corridors that received customized assistance to meet their  needs through Invest in Neighborhoods. Invest in Neighborhoods aims to strengthen and revitalize neighborhood commercial districts around the City by marshaling and deploying resources from across multiple departments and nonprofit partners. These include economic development services such as loan programs, facade improvement grants, and technical assistance for small businesses.

## Every resident within a 10 minute walk of a park

Under Mayor Lee, San Francisco was the first city in the nation to be given a perfect park access score from The Trust for Public Land’s ParkScore. The City’s rich store of recreation locations mean every resident isn’t more than 10 minutes from a park.
