Data Academy started in 2014 with a handful of workshops on data visualization and has grown to over 15 courses (for more history see this article). Each month, city and county employees carve out time in their day to spread the data-love by either teaching or attending a workshop. One of the goals in founding Data Academy was to help City Departments make more of their decisions with information and data. 
## Dog fooding a data driven approach
Data drives course creation. It is only fitting that Data Academy itself be run with an intense passion for metrics. If you are a city employee, you are probably familiar with our annual Analyst Survey. In the survey, we ask about training needs. Many of our courses trace their birth to this survey.
Data informs course improvement. Plus, we track the quality of instruction and material. Since the beginning of Data Academy, we survey all workshop attendees immediately after the course to identify areas of strength and improvement for each course. 
Data measures course impact. We are now happy to introduce the next phase of evaluation for Data Academy: Impact Metrics. We know Data Academy courses are responding to a need and that quality of instruction is consistently high. We also knew informally that analysts found it valuable. But until now we lacked a systematic way of tracking the return on investment of classes. How has it impacted analysts’ day to day work? How much time (if any) are they saving? 
## How we measure impact
The Controller’s Office closed our impact measurement gap by instituting at six month lag impact survey. We survey Data Academy attendees six months after their workshop about how the course impacted (or didn’t) their work. As so many city employees have gone through workshops already, the Controller’s office fielded a ‘catch up’ survey to gauge how those courses have affected analyst’s work. DataSF and Controller’s office are proud to present the results of this initial survey today.
## The results: Estimate of 1.7 million in annual savings

## Join the fun
We are super excited about these results. We couldn’t have done it without the instructors who have donated their time to train their fellow city and county employees. If you are interested in teaching please reach out. If you are a city and county employee you can sign up to be notified of the next data academy offering here.
