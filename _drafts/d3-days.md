Last Friday over analyst came to City Hall for the inaugural D3 Days. &nbsp;

D3 stands for:

* Data - City Analyst love it
* Drinks - DataSF provided them
* Demos - City Analyst gave them

D3 Days is way for City analyst to present and discuss current or recently completed projects. &nbsp;So much great data work occurs each day across the city, we thought it was a shame there was no communal forum for analyst to share ideas, successes, and frustrations with their compatriots in the data trenches.

For the inaugural kick off event we had the past recipients of [the Data & Innovation awards](https://datasf.org/blog/data-shakers-and-innovators/) present. &nbsp;Going forward we are looking for other city analyst who are eager to talk about their current projects in a fun, relaxed setting. &nbsp;If you are a current city or county of San Francisco employee and are interested (or know someone who should be!)
