March is a special month for many reasons: St. Patrick’s Day, start of spring, and daylight savings time. But here at DataSF there is one extra special day we prize above all the others…

## International Open Data Day!!!

As is tradition, DataSF is celebrating big time and YOU are invited. &nbsp;We are participating in SF’s [Open Data Day](https://www.meetup.com/Code-for-San-Francisco-Civic-Hack-Night/events/237515330/) Celebration brought to you by the brilliant folks from Code for San Francisco. &nbsp;It will be held at the Microsoft Reactor and you can register for this free all day event [here](https://www.meetup.com/Code-for-San-Francisco-Civic-Hack-Night/events/237515330/). &nbsp;There will be activities for all levels of engagement:

* Have an amazing idea for a project involving open data? Great! There will be opportunities to pitch it.
* Want to help pitch in and join a project? Plenty of opportunity for that.
* Just want to take it all in or learn something new? &nbsp;DataSF will be running a learning track on using the SF Open Data portal. &nbsp;&nbsp;

This year Open Data Day is focusing on 4 key areas:

* Open Research Data
* Tracking Public Money Flows
* Open Data for the Environment
* Open Data for Human Rights

In anticipation of the festivities, DataSF would like to shine a spotlight on a selection of San our datasets that speak to some of these topics.

#### Tracking Public Money Flows

Where does the money go? Nobody does this better in SF than the Ethics Commission and Budget Office. &nbsp;

One of the key mandates of the Ethics Commission is in educating the public of campaign and lobbyist spending. While the scale and amount of [datasets the Ethics Commission publishes](https://data.sfgov.org/browse?Department-Metrics_Publishing-Department=Ethics+Commission&amp;category=City+Management+and+Ethics&amp;limitTo=datasets) can be overwhelming, here are some choice selections:

* [Lobbyist Activity - Contacts of Public Officials](https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Lobbyist-Activity-Contacts-of-Public-Officials/hr5m-xnxc): &nbsp;A dataset of each lobby visit. &nbsp;A treasure trove containing who was doing the lobbying, what official they talked to, and why.
* [Lobbyist Activity - Payments Promised By Clients](https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Lobbyist-Activity-Payments-Promised-By-Clients/s2fy-y3my): A dataset of lobbyist contributions. &nbsp;Contains lobbyist, firm, payment amount, and client.
* [Lobbyist Activity - Political Contributions](https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Lobbyist-Activity-Political-Contributions/sa8r-purn): All political contributions of $100 of more by Lobbyist.
* [Campaign Consultants - Client Payment](https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Campaign-Consultants-Client-Payments/tc9q-72uj): Record of payments to campaign consultants

To zoom out we turn to the Mayor’s Budget Office which keeps tabs on the City and County budget. &nbsp;The two relevant datasets are:

[Budget](https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Budget/xdgd-c79v): This covers the budgets of the various departments

[Budget - FTE](https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Budget-FTE/4zfx-f2ts): This dataset provides salary information for each department and associated department programs.

#### Open Data for the Environment

The Planning Department and Public Works has just launched a fantastic new dataset of every public trees in SF. &nbsp;The project is appropriately titled [EveryTreeSF](http://sf-planning.org/everytreesf-%E2%80%93-street-tree-census). &nbsp;The icing on this delicious data cake is an [interactive map](http://urbanforestmap.org/tag/everytreesf/) that allows you to select any tree and find out a variety of eco benefits. &nbsp;You of course have access to the cake as well.

[Street Tree](http://urbanforestmap.org/tag/everytreesf/) - You can export all the underlying data via the export button at the top. &nbsp;Inside you will fine geo coordinates, species, dimensions, and tree condition.

The Department of the Environment also maintains a couple datasets around emissions and energy performance:

[Existing Commercial Buildings Energy Performance Ordinance Report](https://data.sfgov.org/Energy-and-Environment/Existing-Commercial-Buildings-Energy-Performance-O/j2j3-acqj): All commercial buildings with at least 10k sq ft of conditioned space must track how much energy their building uses each year. &nbsp;You can read more about the enacting ordinance [here](https://sfenvironment.org/energy/energy-efficiency/commercial-and-multifamily-properties/existing-commercial-buildings-energy-performance-ordinance).

[San Francisco Municipal Greenhouse Gas Inventory](https://data.sfgov.org/Energy-and-Environment/San-Francisco-Municipal-Greenhouse-Gas-Inventory/pxac-sadh): this dataset tracks each city and county departments greenhouse gas emissions. &nbsp;

# Call for Action

DataSF is part of nation-wide network of Data Officers known as the Civics Analytic Network. &nbsp;This year for International Open Data day the network identified key areas Open Data Platform providers need to address to fulfill the promise of open, meaningful, and impactful data.
