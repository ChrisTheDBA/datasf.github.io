## About this course

This classroom based workshop is the third in a series of workshops on Tableau offered by the Data Academy. &nbsp;Tableau Public is a free data visualization software that allows you to quickly create charts, maps, and dashboards with interactive filtering and drill-down capabilities. &nbsp; &nbsp;

This course is a natural continuation of our first two Tableau trainings (Introduction to Tableau and Intermediate Tableau I). &nbsp;We will show you how to create a compelling story by stringing your cool charts together in a management dashboard. &nbsp;
