## About this course

In this classroom based workshop, you will learn the basics of undertaking a Business Process Improvement (BPI) project. The focus will be on the basics of developing a high-level process map in PowerPoint and conducting process analysis.

This training is recommended for anyone who is new to process mapping and analysis, and is especially recommended for people who have a BPI project in mind or are just getting started. The training will include some time to allow participants to work on their own BPI project. If you don&iacute;t have a project, don&iacute;t worry! We will bring a few examples of processes that you can practice mapping in PowerPoint.
