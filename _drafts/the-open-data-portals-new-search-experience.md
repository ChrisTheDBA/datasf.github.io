[Socrata](https://www.socrata.com) has been rolling out a new search experience across their customer sites. We're happy to announce, we've just gone live with the new search in our data catalog. If you're used to the old search experience, it'll feel different, but in this case, that's a good thing!

Two major shifts have happened with the new search experience:

1. Better, cleaner user interface and experience
2. More relevant search results


Together, these mean a much more useful way of finding data you need in the catalog. You can read [more about the changes on Socrata's website](https://support.socrata.com/hc/en-us/articles/219007257).

Let us know what you think of the new experience.
