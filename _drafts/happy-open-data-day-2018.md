March is here already and with it we are excited to celebrate **International Open Data Day!**

We'll be joining the our local host, Code for San Francisco, for a day filled with projects and an "unconference" agenda created by participants. We hope YOU will join us there tomorrow, March 3rd, 2018. You can RSVP [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/code-for-san-francisco-open-data-day-2018-tickets-42826162204).

While you'll be able to talk about all things open data, there are a couple of general themes from the international organizers. This year, they are:

1. Open research data
2. Tracking public money flows
3. Open mapping
4. Data for equal development

In anticipation of tomorrow's event, we wanted to highlight a couple of datasets that are captured by some of these topics.

## Tracking public money flows
