Inger joined the City in May 2014 after 13 years in the non-profit sector. Inger served as Operations Manager for the David and Lucile Packard Foundation working on cloud-server migration, systems change and process improvement. As Director of Programs for the Women’s Foundation of California, she led a team of six smart do-gooders who pursued social justice for low-income Californians through grantmaking, public policy, and technical assistance and training. At the Advancement Project, she developed a new program that analyzed local, state and federal government spending to support policy and systems change. In all of her work, she enjoys improving processes, increasing efficiency and effectiveness, and helping people feel better about their work. She has an MA in Economics from Claremont Graduate University, which included coursework at the Drucker and Ito School of Management, and a BA in Women’s Studies from Mary Washington College. She has special training in business process improvement, strengths-based management and non-profit and government finance.
