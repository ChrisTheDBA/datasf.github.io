Marc gets to manage the [Human Service Agency's Innovation Office](http://sfhsainnovationoffice.tumblr.com/) with the aim of improving how clients and employees experience service delivery. He trains and leads teams of coworkers to use service design to reduce or remove the pain-points that they, clients and community partners experience. His practice of service design continually evolves by blending Human-Centered Design, user experience and social science research, visual facilitation, design strategy, Lean Process Improvement, and Results-Based Accountability. He learns much from those working in this space both domestically and internationally. Marc is also championing the Agency's emergent digital strategy to better its website design and content. He is a former Code for America fellow, and holds a PhD in Applied Anthropology from the University of South Florida, an MA from American University that focused on International Economic Policy and a BA in Interdisciplinary Studies from the University of Florida.
